# OP style guide

For general style, follow Google's JS/ES6 style guide:

https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html

Most importantly, use `const` and `let` instead of `var`, use semicolons and define strings with `'`. Also try to take advantage of all the good things that entails, like for-of loops and `=>` arrow notation.

Also 2 space tabs. JS has way too many anonymous functions and shit to use anything bigger.
